## Iâ€™m Kevin, and this is my web site.

## About me

In my professional life I'm a system administrator. Servers and networks and security and all that stuff. I've been an amateur radio operator (call sign KB9MQU) since 1996, and currently hold a General class operator license. I also find aviation interesting, and you can browse some of the photos I've taken at airshows in the last few years.
