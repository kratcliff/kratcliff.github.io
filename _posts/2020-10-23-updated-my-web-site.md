title: "Updated my web site"

I am just finishing up a domain switch and web site migration. My primary [email address](/contact/) has changed, though my old address still works. My domain for this web site is now [ratcliff.io](https://ratcliff.io/), with [kevinratcliff.com](https://kevinratcliff.com/) being redirected here.
