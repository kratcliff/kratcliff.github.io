## About me

In my professional life I'm a system administrator. Servers and networks and security and all that stuff. I've been an amateur radio operator (call sign KB9MQU) since 1996, and currently hold a General class operator license. I also find aviation interesting, and you can browse some of the photos Iâ€™ve taken at airshows in the last few years.

## About this web site

I've had my own web site for quite some time. Over the years the various hosting options have changed, and the site is now being hosted by GitHub Pages.
